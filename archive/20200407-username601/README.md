this is the repository for [username601](https://top.gg/bot/696973408000409626) the bot i made in quarantine because i'm bored, also the home of the spaghetti code.
feel free to contribute! (good luck i guess)

this bot uses a highly modified version of discord.py. (i modified some functions from it to modify it's caching behaviour. [See this line of code for context](https://github.com/null8626/username601/blob/master/framework/__init__.py#L53)
